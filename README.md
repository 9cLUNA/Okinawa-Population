# Learning python & pandas with Okinawa population data

The goal here is to use python with pandas to see what the population make-up of Okinawa, Japan will be in 2020 and beyond.

## Getting Started

I opted to just use Jupyter Notebook so I can easily see the results and provide myself feedback. Simiply click the oki_pop.ipynb file to see the live notebook of code for the project.

## Built With

* [Python 3](https://www.python.org/) - High-level, general purpose programming language.
* [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/) - Web application to create documents that contain live code and visualization.
* [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) - Analysis using data structures and operations for manipulation of numerical tables and time series.
* [numpy](http://www.numpy.org/) - Support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, along with a large collection of mathematical functions.
* [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/) - Plotting library for embedding visual plots into applications such as Jupyter Notebook.

Data

* [Population Data](https://www.e-stat.go.jp/en) - Demographic Statistics
